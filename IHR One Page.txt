The most hated excercise, besides leg day, is running. Why? Fresh air, jam out to music, chat with friends; just of the few benefits of running.
Oh, yeah, and it's really good for you! The goal of I Hate Running is to introduce more people to the wonderful world of running.

It all starts with a goal. A finish line. Find a race that is in your area in the near future. Sign up for it and add it to your account.
That's the hard part. Now all you have to do is run. Throw on some sneakers and run around the block. Walk around the block.
Keep track of your progress so at race day, you can look back and see just how far you've come. Then sign up for another race!

IHR uses React/Bootstrap on the front end, Spring Web using Java, and PostgreSQL on the back end.
